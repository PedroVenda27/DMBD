## 📌 CRISP-DM Methodology

The project was developed according to the phases of the **CRISP-DM methodology**:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   - Define the project objectives and the business problem.  
   - Identify success criteria and constraints.  

2. **Data Understanding**  
   - Initial data collection.  
   - Data exploration and description in RapidMiner.  
   - Identification of data quality issues.  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Data cleaning and transformation.  
   - Selection of relevant features.  
   - Building the final dataset for modeling.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Application of Data Mining algorithms (classification, clustering, regression, etc.).  
   - Parameter tuning and model training in RapidMiner.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assess the results against the defined objectives.  
   - Compare models and select the most suitable one.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Preparation of report and visualizations.  
   - Discussion of results and conclusions.  
   - Documentation for future use.
