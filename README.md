## 📌 CRISP-DM Methodology

The project will be developed according to the **CRISP-DM** phases:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   - Define the project goals and the business problem.  
   - Identify success criteria and constraints.  

2. **Data Understanding**  
   - Collect the initial dataset.  
   - Explore and describe the data using RapidMiner.  
   - Detect potential quality issues.  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clean and transform the dataset.  
   - Select relevant attributes/features.  
   - Build the final dataset for modeling.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Apply data mining techniques (classification, clustering, regression, etc.).  
   - Train and tune models in RapidMiner.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assess results against the business objectives.  
   - Compare models and select the best one.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Prepare reports and visualizations.  
   - Present results and conclusions.  
   - Document the process for future use.
